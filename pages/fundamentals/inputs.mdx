# Input configuration

BioSNICAR is configured by updating the values in the config file `inputs.yaml`. This file is divided into subsections for variables that correspond to specific parts of the model. 
These are: 

- **`PATHS`**: paths to specific files
- **`CTRL`**: variables that control how the program executes ("metaconfig")
- **`RTM`**: variables that configure the radiative transfer model
- **`ICE`**: variables that adjust the ice physical properties
- **`IMPURITIES`**: properties of impurities included in the simulation
- **`PLOT`**: configuration for plotting output data
- **`BIOOPTICAL`**: configuration for the bio-optical model, if it is being run

The user sets the desired values in inputs.yaml and then there is no need to interact with any other script in the repository apart from simply running the driver:

`python src/main.py`. 

However, the value choices are quite nuanced and require some explanation. 
In this document, the meaning of each field in `inputs.yaml` is defined along with any constraints and defaults.

## PATHS

The paths to specific files are defined here. The user should not change these paths. The root directory is automatically detected. All other paths are relative to the base directory and do not need to be updated. 

## CTRL

Parameters related to the model execution.

### SMOOTH

#### Definition

Boolean that toggles smoothing of the predicted albedo. If `SMOOTH{'=='}True` a Savitsky-Golay smoothing function is applied to the spectral albedo, with a window size and polynomial order defined by `WINDOW_SIZE` and `POLY_ORDER` respectively.

#### Values

`True` or `False`

#### Default

`False`

### WINDOW_SIZE

#### Definition

Interpolation window width used in Savisky-Golay filter if `SMOOTH{'=='}True`.

#### Values

Positive integer. Technically valid between 2-480 but practical between {'~'}5{'-'}20.

#### Default

`9`


### POLY_ORDER

#### Definition

Order of polynomial interpolation function used in Savisky-Golay filter if `SMOOTH{'=='}True`.

#### Values

Positive integer. Technically any valid but practical between {'~'}5{'-'}20.

#### Default

`3`


## RTM

### DIRECT

#### Definition

Toggles between incoming irradiance being diffuse or direct. It's effect is to change a string stub that generates the filepath used to load in iorradiance from file. If direct irradiance is toggled the model reads in a file whose name contains "_clr_" and a solar zenith angle. 

#### Values

`0` for diffuse irradiance. 

`1` for direct irradiance.

#### Default

`1`

### NBR_WVL


#### Definition

Number of individual wavelengths considered by the model. Under normal circumstances the wavelength range is from 0.205 um to 4.995 um in steps of 10 nm, giving 480 individual wavelengths.

#### Values

positive integer

#### Default

`480`

### APRX_TYP


#### Definition

Chooses two-stream approximation type. There are three choices:  `Eddington`, `Quadrature` and `Hemispheric mean`. Each is a way to integrate over angle to give a single upwards and downwards flux. The hemispheric mean is derived by assuming the phase function to equal 1 + g (where g= asymmetry parameter) in the forward scattering hemisphere and 1-g in the backward scattering hemisphere. The hemispheric mean is useful for resolving instabilities in the infrared wavelengths. The equations for each of these approximations is provided in Toon et al. (1989) Table 1. 
    
These choices are only available for the Toon solver - the adding-doubling solver uses hemispheric mean automatically.

#### Values

`0`  (`Eddington`)
 
`1` (`Quadrature`)
 
`2`  (`Hemispheric mean`)

#### Default

`2`

### DELTA

#### Definition**

Toggles whether or not the delta function approximation is applied. The delta function truncates the forward scattering peak in the phase function and compensates by adjusting the volume scattering coefficient. 

This choice is only available for the Toon solver - adding-doubling applies the delta function automatically.

#### Values

`True`:  Delta function
 
`False`:  No Delta function
    
#### Default

`True`


### SOLZEN

#### Definition

Solar zenith angle. This refers to the angular position of the solar disc relative to vertical (nadir {'='} 0, horizon {'='} 90) expressed in degrees.

#### Values

Positive integer degrees.
For the Toon solver there are known instabilities for solzen outside the range 50-89. For the AD solver any positive integer between 1-89 is valid.
    
#### Default

`50`

### INCOMING

#### Definition

Chooses spectal profile for incoming irradiance from one of seven presets. These are:
   
- `0`: mid-latitude winter

- `1`: mid-latitude summer

- `2`: sub-Arctic winter

- `3`: sub-Arctic summer

- `4`: Summit,Greenland (sub-Arctic summer, surface pressure of 796hPa)

- `5`: High Mountain (summer, surface pressure of 556 hPa)

- `6`: Top-of-atmosphere

Note that clear-sky spectral fluxes are loaded when `direct_beam{'='}1`,
and cloudy-sky spectral fluxes are loaded when `direct_beam{'='}0`.

#### Values

Positive integer between 0 and 6
    
#### Default

`4`


### ILLUMINATION_FILE_STUBS

#### Definition

These file stubs are used to select the correct file to open for the incoming irradiance depending on the value of incoming and solzen.

#### Values

The file stubs are strings and they are constant - do not change.

#### Default

```python3
"swnb_480bnd_mlw", 
"swnb_480bnd_mls", 
"swnb_480bnd_saw", 
"swnb_480bnd_sas",  
"swnb_480bnd_smm", 
"swnb_480bnd_hmn", 
"swnb_480bnd_trp"
```


### VIS_MAX_IDX

#### Definition

The index in wavelengths of the upper wavelength in the visible range.

#### Values

Technically any positive integer between 1 and 480 is valid, but practically values close to 39 are appropriate as this corresponds to wavelength {'=='} 0.7um.

#### Default

`39`

### NIR_MAX_IDX

#### Definition

The index in wavelengths of the upper wavelength in the near-infrared range.

#### Values

Technically any positive integer between 1 and 480 is valid, but practically values close to 480 are appropriate as this corresponds to wavelength {'=='} 4.995 um.

#### Default

`480`

## ICE

### DZ

#### Definition

Thickness of each layer in the model in units of meters.

#### Values

Array with `length {'=='} nbr_lyr`. Each element is the thickness of a layer in meters. `dz[0]` is the top layer.

#### Default

`[0.1, 0.1]`

### LAYER_TYPE

#### Definition

There are two layer tupes available in the model** granular or solid ice. Granular ice corresponds to a bulk medium of air with discrete ice grains. Solid ice refers to ice being the bulk medium with air inclusions. Solid ice layers have Fresnel reflection at their upper surfaces.

The toon solver can only accept granular layers. The adding-doubling solver accepts either type including a mix of both in any order.

#### Values

- `0`: granular ice
- `1`: solid ice

#### Default

`[0, 0]`


### RHO

#### Definition

Ice density in each layer measured in kg/m3. 

#### Values

Positive integers up to 917 (density of pure ice).

#### Default

`[400, 400]`


### RF

#### Definition

Choice of refractive index for ice. The refractive index of pure ice has been measured several times over the past 5 decades. Here we toggle between several of those datasets. The options are:


- `0`: Warren et al. (1984)

- `1`: Warren et al. (2008)

- `2`: Picard et al. (2016)


#### Values

Positive integer between 0 and 2.

#### Default

`2 `

### CDOM

#### Definition

Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is coloured organic matter that can be found in glacier meltwater. This variable toggles its presence on or off in each layer. This is an experimental feature that only allows a single concentration and it can only be added to solid ice layers (layer_type{'='}1). The CDOM absorption data come from an upcoming paper by Halbach et al. Toggling CDOM on means adjustign the imaginary refractive index of the ice for the presence of CDOM, assuming it to well mixed through the ice layer.

#### Values

`0` for no CDOM, 
 
`1` for CDOM

#### Default

`[0, 0]`


### SHP

#### Definition

Shape of ice grains. Adjustments for grain shape can only be made when layer_type {'=='} 0. The available shapes are:

- `0`: sphere

- `1`: spheroid

- `2`: hexagonal plate

- `3`: koch snowflake

- `4`: hexagonal prisms


The adjustments to the loaded optical properties for spheroids, hexagonal plates and Koch snowflakes are according to Fu et al. 2007 and He et al. 2016. Hexagonal columns are calculated offline using geometric optics calculations and loaded in as separate files.

#### Values

Positive integer between 0 and 4

#### Default

`[0, 0]`

### RDS

#### Definition

Effective radius of ice grains if `layer_type{'=='}0` and effective radius of air bubbles if `layer_type{'=='}1`. The valid range varies according to choice of RF - we have a larger database for Picard et al. 2016 refractive indices than the other because it is our default. Please check the /Data/OP_data/480band/ directory for available radii.

#### Values

Positive integer between 30 and 20000 (if `rf{'=='}2`).

#### Default

`[1000, 1000]`

### WATER

#### Definition

Thickness of liquid water coating around ice grains. Only valid when `shp{'=='}0` and `layer_type{'=='}0`. The value given should be the total radius of the grain and its water coating. For example for a 100 um grain with a 10 um water coating, the value of WATER should be 110. Providing a value that is less than the value provided for rds effectively toggles this off. The water coatings are quite expensive calculations as they run a Mir scattering code on the fly. Therefore they are off by default.

#### Values

Positive integer.

#### Default

`[0, 0]`

### HEX_SIDE

#### Definition

Length of one of the six sides of the hexagonal face of the iuce grain when `shp{'=='}4`. The available size combinations can be seen by browsing /Data/OP_data/480band/ice_hexagonal_columns.

#### Values

Positive integer.

#### Default

### SHP_FCTR

#### Definition

#### Values

Float between 0-1.

#### Default

`[0, 0]`


### AR

#### Definition

Aspect ratio of grain, i.e. ratio of width to length. 

#### Values

Positive float or integer.

#### Default

`[0, 0]`


## IMPURITIES

Impurities are provided as instances of the `Impurity` class. The clas has fixed attributes that must be populated in order for the impurity to be included in the mdoel. These attributes are: `NAME`, `FILE`, `CFACTOR`, `COATED`, `UNIT`, and `CONC`. These are user defined in `inputs.yaml`. There is no upper or lower limit to the number of different impurities that can be added - the user can simply continue to stack additional impurities in the `IMPURITIES` section of `inputs.yaml`. The basic structure of an impurity as defined in `inputs.yaml` is as follows:

```python3
IMPURITIES
BC:
    NAME:  "bc"
    FILE:  "bc_ChCB_rn40_dns1270.nc"
    CFACTOR:  1
    COATED:  False
    UNIT:  0
    CONC:  [0 ,0]

### UNIT

All these impurities have their mass absorption coefficients in units of ppb, and therefore their concentration (CONC) should be expressed normalised to mass in the model - i.e. in ng/g or ppb. This is achieved by setting `UNIT {'=='}0`. There are two exceptions to this:  "SA_Chevrollier2022_r8.99.nc" and "GA_Chevrollier2022_r4.9_L18.8.nc". These are empirically measured optical properties for snbow and glacier algae whose absorption coefficient is expressed in m2/cell. Their concentration (`CONC`) should therefore be expressed in cells/mL. This is achieved by setting `UNIT{'=='}1`. There are validity checks in place to ensure these values are set correctly.

### CONC

Array containing the concentration in each layer in the model in units defined by UNIT. 

### CFACTOR

#### Definition
The CFACTOR attribute is a multiplier that accounts for field measurments having a coarse vertical resolution but the model having fine vertical resolution. This is mostly applicable to glacier algae that are known to accumulate on the upper surface of the ice, but field samples generally are onyl able to remove the top approx. 2cm for cell counting. this leads to an underestimate of the concentration int he upper mm by including {'~'}2cm of dilute clean ice below. `CFACTOR` accounts for this problem. It is a simple multiplier so it must be set to 1 by default.

#### Values

Positive numbers

#### Default

`1`

### COATED

#### Definition

Boolean that toggles sulfate coating on or off. This is only applicable to black and brown carbon where there are files for both coated an uncoated versions. The parameter is requird because a different field in the optical property file is loaded for coated compared to uncoated impurities, so that the mass normalization takes into account the mass of both the impurity and its coating.

#### Values

`true` or `false`

#### Default

`false`
