# biosnicar app

You can access the `biosnicar` app at [https://bit.ly/biosnicar](https://bit.ly/biosnicar).

## Using the App

The app is designed to make using `biosnicar` as easy as possible. You do not have to interact with any code - you can just set the values you want to use in the browser and the model will
automatically update on the screen. You can download the data any time by clicking `Download data`.

## How the app works

`biosnicar` is a Streamlit app, which means the entire stack, from the model right through to the front end is all written in Python. 
You can find the app's source code in the `biosnicar` [Github repository](https://github.com/jmcook1186/biosnicar-py/tree/master/app/streamlit) in `/app/streamlit`.
The biosnicar model is run any time an input field is changed, and the spectral albedo data automatically updates.

The options offered in the app are intentionally minimal. If you want to access the full `biosnicar` functionality you should download and run the model code. 
The app is designed to give users access to `biosnicar` fundamentals quickly and easily, without having to handle any code.

## Updating the app

You can add and remove functions by modifying the app source code and running locally, by running the following command in your terminal (from the project directory):

```sh
./start_app.sh
```

If your changes would be useful to other users, you can raise a pull request to make them part of the online app!
