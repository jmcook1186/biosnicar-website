# Running the model

To run the `biosnicar` model, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Then, you can download the mdoel code from the [Github repository](https://github.com/jmcook1186/biosnicar-py/tree/master).
Then, you can install the project dependencies and start using `biosnicar`!

## Installing Environment/Dependencies

If you do not have Python installed, download Python >3.8. It is recommended to use a fresh environment using conda or venv. Once activated, install the project dependencies with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now install `biosnicar`:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

Finally, if you do not wish to install anything on your computer, but you use VSCode and Docker, then you can use the devcontainer config provided to run this code in a remote container. 
This requires the "remote containers" extension to be added to VSCode. Further instructions are available here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers


## Running the code

The model driver and all the core source code can be found in `/src/biosnicar`. From the top level directory (`~/BioSNICAR_GO_PY`), run:

`python ./src/biosnicar/snicar_driver.py`

This will run the model with all the default settings. The user will see a list of output values printed to the console and a spectral albedo plot appear in a separate window. The code can also be run in an interactive session (Jupyter/iPython) in which case the relevant data and figure will appear in the interactive console.

Most users will want to experiment with changing input parameters. This is achieved by adjusting the values in the config file `inputs.yaml`. The nature of each parameter is described in in-line annotations to guide the user. Invalid combinations of values will be rejected by our error-checking code. Most users should have no reason to modify any other file in this repository except for the those in `inputs.yaml`.

More complex applications of the model code, for example model inversions, field/model comparisons etc are all possible, with details provided in these docs under `Usage examples`.


## Choosing Inputs

It is straightforward to adjust the model configuration by updating the values in `inputs.yaml`. 
However there is a lot of nuance to setting up the model to provide realistic simulations, and the meaning of the various parameters is not always obvious. 
For now, you can refer to the reference documentation on this site in the `modules` section. However, we are developing a guide for choosing inputs that will be shipped soon!
