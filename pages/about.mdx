## About biosnicar

### What is `biosnicar`?

`biosnicar` is a model, written in Python, for predicting the spectralalbedo of snow and ice. The model is broken down into vertical layers, each of which can have different physical properties and impurity concentrations. Given the illumination conditions, `biosnicar` can calculate the spectral albedo. 
`biosnicar` is available as Python code, or it can be run in a web browser using our [app](https://bit.ly/bio-snicar). We have designed `biosnicar` to be as flexible, offering multiple options for the radiative transfer solver used, a library of ice refractive indices, illumination profiles and impurity types.
We have also made the code as modular and composable as possible so that advanced users can be creative in building `biosnicar` applications!

### Theoretical Background

#### Snow and Ice

The snow and ice single scattering properties are generated from the refractive index of ice from Warren 1984, Warren 2008 or Picard 2016. 
Snow and ice are represented either as a collection of grains in a bulk medium of air, or as a slab of ice with embedded air bubbles. 
To model slabs of ice, the model uses an adding-doubling solver with Fresnel layers. The air bubbles are represented as spheres, and the optical properties are calculated using Mie theory (Whicker et al. 2022). 
Collections of grains can be represented as spheres using Mie theory, as spheroids, hexagonal plates or koch snowflakes using calculations adapted from Mie theory (He et al. 2017, 2018), or hexagonal prisms using geometric optics (van Diedenhoven 2014, Cook et al. 2020).
There are two radiative transfer solvers available for collections of grains: adding-doubling and a matrix solution developed by Toon et al. (2009). 
There is also an option to add liquid water coating around the grains using two-layer coated sphere Mie calculations (Niklas Bohn, 01/05/2020). 
Note that running the model with spherical grains, the Toon solver and no biological particles is equivalent to running the original SNICAR model of Flanner et al. (2007, 2009). The current parametrisation is based on CDOM absorption measurements carried on samples from south-eastern greenlandic glaciers (Halbach et al. 2022).

#### Light absorbing particles

`biosnicar` includes a fairly large library of light absorbing particles that can be incorporated easily into albedo simulations. These built-in impurities include a wide range of biotic and abotic particles whose optical properties were empirically measured and published in the scientific literature.
The `biosnicar` repository also includes a separate module for calculating the relevant optical properties for any particle, so that you can create your own particle types.

The impurity library that comes with `biosnicar` prioritizes those with empirically-measured optical properties, or impurities whose optical properties are available in the science literature.

However, we also provide a `bio-optical` module that includes a model to calculate the single-scattering optical properties of pigmented algae, given user defined shape and pigment concentrations.
Two options for impurity optical property calculations are available: spherical cells as per ice grains using Mie theory, typically used for snow algae, and circular based cylinders using geometric optics typically used for glacier algae that are long chains of cells approximated as cylinders after Lee and Pilon, 2013. 
The user needs to feed the bio-optical model with the refractive index and absorption cross section of the cell, along with algae dry and wet density and cell size. 
The absorption cross section can be calculated in the model from intracellular pigment concentrations (Cook et al. 2017; pigment absorption coefficients from Bidigare 1990, Halbach 2022, Clementson and Wojtasiewicz 2019)) or loaded directly if they have been measured empirically for real cells. 
The model saves the relevant data in file that can be loaded into `biosnicar`.
As well as cells, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) on snow/ice optical properties can be incorporated in the model too, using absorption data from Halbach et al (2022).

#### `biosnicar` history

`biosnicar` began as a straightforward translation of the original SNICAR code (Flanner et al. 2009) into Python. 
The motivation was to ensure access to the SNICAR model code in an open source language that didn't require a proprietary license, and also add some new impurity types. 
In the first version of `biosnicar`, the impurity optical properties were theoretical, based upon a pigment mixing model and values for the mass absorption coefficient of each pigment from the marine phytoplankton literature. 
The snow and ice optical properties were based on Mie theory assuming all grains to be relatively small and spherical. The next iteration of the model added support for large grains whose optical properties were calculated using geometric optics instead of Mie theory. 
The rationale was that this would be better for simulating the large blocky pieces of ice observed in the porous "weathering crust" on the Greenland Ice Sheet and elsewhere. However, it was later discovered that the most accurate way to simulate the weathered crust was by representing them as solid ice slabs and using an adding-doubling solver (After Whicker et al 2022). 
This was added as a third option to the model in 2022. Soon after, empirical values for glacier algae optical properties were measured by Chevrollier et al (2022) and incorporated into the mdoel in place of the original "theoretical" values. 
`biosnicar` v2 finally shipped after a complete refactor of the code base, deprecating the old model structure inhertied from the Matlab code and rewriting it in an object-oriented style that made the model more flexible and easier to use. 
Finally, to make `biosnicar` accessible to non-coders, a web application was shipped in 2022 that allows users to generate albedo spectra in the browser. 

#### What is `biosnicar` used for?

`biosnicar` is primarily used to predict the spectral and broadband albedo of snow and ice surfaces with specific configurations of ice and particle optical properties and spatial organization and illumination conditions. 
Researchers interested in the effect of certain particles on snow melt could, for example, simulate deposition events in `biosnicar` and determine the sensitivity of snow and ice to those particles. 
The original use-case for `biosnicar` was to do this kind of simulation to determine the impact of snow and glacier algae on melt rates.

However, `biosnicar` has also been used in other ways. Running `biosnicar` in the default way gives a single albedo spectrum for a given input configuration, but `biosnicar` is also highly parallelizable, making it possible to quickly do thousands of simulations. 
This is useful for remote sensing applications where large numbers of `biosnicar` spectra can be organized into a look-up table for classifying ice surfaces from satellite data, or quantifying particles on the surface.

The model can also be inverted, so that instead of answering the question "what is the albedo with these input values?" you can ask "what input values lead to this albedo?" This is a powerful way to *explain* observations made in the field or by remote sensing.

It is also possible to output data other than albedo from the model. For example, `biosnicar` can be used to model actinic fluxes and absorbed energy with depth in a snowpack or ice column. There are many parameters that can be output from the model that users can explore.

The `user guides` directory shows how `biosnicar` can be used in these non-standard ways. There are many other potential uses for the `biosnicar` code base, we would love to see more creative applications!
