# bubble_reff_calculator module

Calculates effective radius of air bubbles.

This script is for taking specific surface area for bubbly ice an calculating the effective radius of the bubbles assuming a lognormal bubble size distribution.

The reason this is required is that the well-known conversion between SSA and r_eff:

```sh
r_eff = 3/(P_i * SSA) where P_i is density of ice (917 kg m-3)
```

gives the effective radius of a discrete grain of given SSA, for a collection of bubbles in a bulk medium of ice a more nuanced calculation is required.
