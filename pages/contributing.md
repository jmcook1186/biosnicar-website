# Contributing to BioSNICAR

You can contribute to BioSNICAR!

You may wish to contribute to BioSNICAR source code, the web application or the documentation (this site). All are very welcome!

## Contributing to BioSNICAR source code

To add a feature, fix a bug or otherwise improve the BioSNICAR model, you can fork the [BioSNICAR Github repository](https://github.com/jmcook1186/biosnicar-py), make changes and raise a pull request. Please add as much detail as possible to the pull request to help reviewers evaluate the changes.

Note that there are some Github Actions set up for any pull requests. Your pull request will be tested against a full set of consistency checks to make sure there are no accidental breakages to the mdoel accuracy or any unintended side-effects.

You can also contribute by adding more tests!

Note that you can go directly to the BioSNICAR Github repository any time by clicking the Github logo in the top right of the browser on this docs website.

## Contributing to the web application

Simplicity is a primary feature of the web application; however, if you have ideas for features or updates to the aesthetic, or you notice any bugs, you can raise pull requests to fix them. The app is built in Streamlit. There are no specific CI tests for the web application yet - you should build the site locally and only raise your PR after you have tested your lcoal build. Reviewers will also build and test locally before accepting any changes to the web app.


## Contributing to the documentation

You can contribute to this site!

The source for this site is in a separate repository from the BioSNICAR source code. This is a static site built using Nextra. If you notice any inconsistencies, errors, typos or missing content, you can fix it by raising a pull request to the [docs repository](https://github.com/jmcook1186/biosnicar-website). Note that on any page of the documentation website, you can simply click `Edit this page` to go directly to the relevant page on Github.


## Making pull requests

To raise a pull request, you must first have a Github account. Then you can "fork" the BioSNICAR repository or the BioSNICAR documentation repository. You can then clone your fork, work on the code, commit and push your changes, and then go back to Github to raise a pull request. For step by step instructions for how to do this, please see the [Github help pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
