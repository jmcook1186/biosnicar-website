## Get started with biosnicar

Here you will find instructions for getting up and running with biosnicar, either via the web app or using the model code.

## Web app

`biosnicar` is available as a web application. Simply direct your browser to

[https://bit.ly/bio-snicar](https://bit.ly/bio-snicar)

This is the simplest way to use `biosnicar`. You can set your input configuration in the labelled fields on the left hand side of the screen and the plot in the centre of the screen will automatically update, providing the spectral albedo. You can also download the spectral albedo data as a csv file by clicking Download Data.

There are some restrictions on the parameter values and the set of available parameters in the web application. For complete control over the model configuration you can download and run the model yourself.

You can also run the app locally. Simply download the `biosnicar` repository, install using `pip install -e .` and then run `./start_app.py`. The app will run at `localhost:8501`.



## Python code

### Installing Environment/Dependencies

If you want to run `biosnicar` in a local Python environment but do not have Python installed, download Python >3.7. 
It is recommended to use a fresh environment using conda or venv. Once activated, install the project dependencies with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install biosnicar using:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

Finally, if you do not wish to install anything on your computer, but you use VSCode and Docker, then you can use the devcontainer config provided to run this code in a remote container. This requires the “remote containers” extension to be added to VSCode. Further instructions are available here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

### Running the model

The model driver (main.py) is in the root repository and all the core source code can be found in `/biosnicar`. From the top level directory (`~/`biosnicar_py`), run:

```sh
python main.py
```

This will run the model with all the default settings. 
The user will see a list of output values printed to the console and a spectral albedo plot appear in a separate window. 
The code can also be run in an interactive session (Jupyter/iPython) in which case the relevant data and figure will appear in the interactive console.

Most users will want to experiment with changing input parameters. 
This is achieved by adjusting the values in the config file `inputs.yaml`. 
The nature of each parameter is described in in-line annotations to guide the user. 
Invalid combinations of values will be rejected by our error-checking code. 
Most users should have no reason to modify any other file in this repository except for the those in `inputs.yaml`.

More complex applications of the model code, for example model inversions, field/model comparisons etc are included under `/experiments`, with details provided in that module’s own README.

We have also maintained a separate version of the `biosnicar` codebase that uses a “functional” progamming style rather than the object-oriented approach taken here. 
We refer to this as `biosnicar` Classic and it is available in the classic branch of this repository. It might be useful for people already familiar with FORTRAN or Matblab implementations from previous literature. 
The two branches are entirely equivalent in their simulations but very different in their programming style. 
The object oriented approach is preferred because it is more Pythonic, more flexible and easier to debug.

### Choosing Inputs

It is straightforward to adjust the model configuration by updating the values in `inputs.yaml`. However there is a lot of nuance to setting up the model to provide realistic simulations, and the meaning of the various parameters is not always obvious. 
We will have a guide on this topic coming soon!

Please note that you can have multiple input files, even saved in an external directory with specific configurations and then loop through them in `main.py`. 
For example, you may wish to conduct an experiment with 10 different model configurations - in this case you could have ten `inputsX.yaml` files in an external directory. 
Then execute all the functions inside the default `main.py` in a simple for loop, assigning each file to input_files in turn. 
This is good for reproducibility as those config files can be archived.

### Bio-optical model

The bio-optical model is generally run separately to the main model code because most users use the default optical properties provided in the downloaded repository. 
However, some users may wish to generate new files. To do this, simply call `run_biooptical_model()` in `main.py` after updating the biooptical section of `inputs.yaml`. 
We expect the bio-optical model to be used rarely.
